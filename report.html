        <h1>Inspiration:</h1>
        <p>1.I have been a car enthusiast from a young age, and I used to watch top gear in the past. "Top Gear" not only showcased a wide 
            range of cars but also presented them in a fun and engaging manner, making it an enjoyable experience for viewers. The show's 
            ability to blend humor, adventure, and in-depth car knowledge left a lasting impression on me, and I want to bring some of that 
            excitement to my own website.</p>
        <p>2."Best Motoring" is a show from Japan that provided in-depth reviews and insights into various types of cars, including new
             models and tuner cars. The show's coverage of the Japanese car culture, tuning scene, and spirited driving performances resonating
             with me. The knowledge and expertise showcased on "Best Motoring" inspired me to create a platform where I could share my own
              insights and passion for cars with others who share similar interests.</p>
        <p>3.Being a F1 (formula 1) fan, I'm deeply inspired by the F1 webpage's ability to immerse fans like myself into the thrilling 
            universe of F1, providing a comprehensive and interactive experience that keeps us hooked throughout the racing season. It's this 
            level of dedication to the craft and passion for all things automotive that fuels my desire to create a webpage that resonates 
            with fellow car enthusiasts and captures the essence of what makes the world of cars and racing so exhilarating.</p>

        <h1>3 ways my site is accessible</h1>
        <p>1.Providing alt text for images: My images includes descriptive alt text attributes, which is important for users who rely on
             screen readers as it provides a textual description of the images, allowing the content to be accessible to individuals 
             with visual impairments.</p>
        <p>2.Responsive design: The webpage is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices. This ensures 
            that users on mobile devices, tablets, or desktops can access the content without issues. </p>
        <p>3.Good colour contrast: My webpage is built on a dark background with white text with this contrast it allows the crucial 
            text to be easily readable, as low contrast text can be challenging for people with visual impairments to read.</p>

        <h1>3 ways that i considered for usability of my site:</h1>
        <p>1.Clear navigation: Having a well-defined and responsive navigation bar enhances user-friendly navigation across the various
             webpages of my website. The headers within the navigation items provide intuitive guidance, making it effortless for users 
             to access different sections of the webpage's content.</p>
        <p>2.Content organisation: Having well organised content on the webpage is one of the factors Ive considered when designing my 
            webpage. I ensure that different content on the same webpage is being organised into separate containers so that the users 
            can easily identify the type of content they are looking at. I framed the containers so that they usually come with a header, 
            description and image.</p>
        <p>3.Sizing of buttons and fonts: Having a webpage with well sized fonts and buttons allows users to comfortably read the contents
            of the webpage with ease regardless of screen size. That is one consideration that i had when designing the webpage hence i make
            sure to make sure that the font sizes are still readable in small screen size and the buttons are easy to click on.
        </p>

        <h1>3 things i have learnt to create the site:</h1>
        <p>In the process of developing my website, I embarked on a journey to learn JavaScript to enhance the interactivity and 
            functionality of my site. JavaScript proved to be a pivotal skill in achieving the desired results. </p>
        <p>1.One fundamental skill I acquired was the ability to add and manipulate CSS classes dynamically using JavaScript. This 
            skill allowed me to alter the appearance and behavior of HTML elements in real-time. For instance, I could change a container 
            styles when users interact with a button. By grasping this concept, I unlocked the potential to create a more engaging and 
            responsive user interface.</p>
        <p>2.Another critical aspect of JavaScript that I delved into was the use of the innerHTML property. This feature enabled me 
            to manipulate the content within HTML elements effortlessly. Whether it was updating text, inserting new content, or 
            creating entirely new containers dynamically, innerHTML became an indispensable tool in my web development toolkit. 
            For instance, I could display user-generated content on my website by dynamically injecting HTML content into designated 
            areas. Thats a function that i implemented into my car_share webpage which allows users to post pictures with captions.</p>
        <p>3.Understanding the Document Object Model (DOM) was central to my JavaScript learning journey. I needed to select specific 
            HTML elements, modify their attributes, and add or remove elements from the webpage as needed. This skill allowed me to 
            create dynamic, data-driven, and user-responsive web pages. It gave me the power to craft an interactive user experience 
            by manipulating the structure and content of the webpage through JavaScript.</p>
        <p>How did i achieve all these learning:</p>
        <p>I leveraged online resources, particularly YouTube tutorials, where they demonstrated practical JavaScript applications. 
            These tutorials provided hands-on guidance. I also looked into javascript documentations to identify the key features that I
             would require during the building of my webpage, and how to use these features. But even with all the youtube tutorials 
             and documentation I was able to learn the most by experimenting and testing of my javscript codes to see how different 
             approaches effected my webpage and how I was able to customise it to meet the requirements of my webpage.</p>

        <h1>What aspect of your work u think were particularly successful?</h1>
        <p>1.Creating a responsive website is crucial for providing a consistent and user-friendly experience across different 
            devices and screen sizes. My successful implementation of Bootstrap, along with custom CSS, ensured that the webpage adapts 
            gracefully to various screen dimensions. This means users can access my content on desktops, tablets, and smartphones without 
            sacrificing usability or readability. It's important to note that responsive design is fundamental for catering to the diverse
             range of devices users might employ to access my site.</p>
        <p>2.The choice of high contrast fonts and appropriate font sizes greatly contributes to the readability and visual appeal
             of my webpage. High contrast fonts make text stand out and are particularly helpful for users with visual impairments or
             those viewing the website in challenging lighting conditions. This decision not only enhances accessibility but also makes 
             my content more engaging and accessible to a broader audience.</p>
        <p>3.My use of JavaScript to enhance interactivity on the webpage is a significant success. It enriches the user experience 
            and encourages engagement with the content. Specific examples, such as displaying additional information when users click 
            the "View Specs" button, enabling event registration, and allowing users to post pictures with captions, demonstrate my 
            commitment to keeping visitors engaged.</p>

        <h1>What aspect of your work could be improved on? How i may do things differently</h1>
        <p>1. Addition of more animations: One area that I envisioned improving was the integration of animations, especially on the 
            review page. Specifically, I aimed to implement a collapsing animation when users clicked on the "View Full Review" button. 
            The idea was to have the "zx_profile" and "review" containers collapse from the top down, creating a visually appealing 
            transition while the "full review" container expanded. Although I drew inspiration from various online sources, I encountered 
            performance issues, including lag, when testing these animations. Upon reflection, I attribute this lag to potential suboptimal 
            JavaScript code optimization. To address this, further refinement and optimization of the JavaScript code would have been 
            necessary to achieve smoother animations.</p>
        <p>2. Potential for improvement in html tags usage: In hindsight, incorporating more HTML elements, such as the strategic use of 
            "section" tags, could have contributed to a more comprehensible and organized representation of different sections within my 
            webpages. This would have aided not only in structuring the content but also in making it easier for developers and 
            collaborators to grasp the layout and hierarchy of the webpage components.</p>
